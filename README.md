### What's This?

The most valuable relationships are not made of two people, they’re made of three. A third person will always stabilize and grow the relationship between the other two. It’s called a [triad](http://www.culturesync.net/toolbox/intro-to-triads), and the more you create, the stronger your network.

This bot passively generates fresh triads of company members to meet every week in an informal standup, or S'Up.

### Install

We host the bot at [sup2.playplay.io](https://sup2.playplay.io).

### History

S'Up for Slack is made possible with the generous support of team [Artsy](https://www.artsy.net). This is a fresh rewrite of [artsy/sup](https://github.com/artsy/sup) for Slack teams during [ArtsyOpenSource](http://artsy.github.io) Hackathon 5.0.
